# CineAlgo 🎬

**Algorithms explained through motion.**

CineAlgo is an educational algorithm visualization platform that treats algorithms as *performances* rather than animations.  
Motion communicates logic, time reveals structure, and every frame exists to teach.

## ✨ What Makes CineAlgo Different

- Deterministic, step-by-step execution  
- Reversible playback (forward, backward, scrub)  
- Explanation-first design — focuses on **why**, not just what  
- Side-by-side algorithm comparison mode  
- Live pseudocode highlighting synchronized with execution  
- Warm, minimal, distraction-free visual design  
- Built entirely with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

No frameworks. No shortcuts.

## 📚 Algorithms Covered

### Sorting
- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort (pivot visualization)  
- Heap Sort (tree-to-array mapping)

### Searching & Pathfinding
- Linear Search  
- Binary Search  
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
- Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
- A* Search  
- Greedy Best-First Search (for contrast)

## 🧠 Educational Philosophy

CineAlgo is designed around three principles:

1. **Correctness before animation**  
2. **Motion as meaning**  
3. **Visual restraint over spectacle**

Algorithms are not animated — they are *performed*.
